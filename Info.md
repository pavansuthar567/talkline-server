Short Reply:
Absolutely correct! ÔøΩÔøΩ
Having the code alone is NOT enough. You need:
Deep Understanding Required:
System Design: Why Redis for caching? Why Kafka for queuing?
Trade-offs: When to use MongoDB vs PostgreSQL? Cache vs DB?
Scalability: How horizontal scaling works? Load balancing strategies?
Performance: Database indexing, query optimization, connection pooling
Architecture: Microservices patterns, event-driven design
Infrastructure: Docker orchestration, cloud deployment, monitoring
What Interviewers Look For:
"Why" decisions: Not just "what" you built
Problem-solving: How you'd handle 10x scale
Trade-offs: Performance vs consistency vs availability
Real-world scenarios: "What if Redis fails?" "How to handle DB sharding?"
Your Advantage:
Code demonstrates implementation skills ‚úÖ
Now need to understand the "why" behind every decision üß†
Practice explaining architecture choices üí¨
Know trade-offs and failure scenarios ‚ö†Ô∏è
Bottom line: Code shows you can build, but deep understanding shows you can architect and scale. Both are needed for SDE-2/3 roles!
