This is chat app for sde 2 role prep to be able to scale 1M req/sec.
Check my full src code which have to server - main server and socket server.
This app uses redis, kafka, sokcet, redis cache is remaining.

So, Check complete app and let me know whiuch things are reamining in complete app flow from socket to main app server.
give me short and concise points wise list of features where code is breaking not connected or remaining things to do as per sde 2 1M scale chat app.

Ran tool
Based on your codebase structure and the semantic search results, here’s a concise, point-wise list of what’s implemented and what’s missing or disconnected for a scalable SDE-2 level chat app (1M req/sec) with main and socket servers, Kafka, Redis, and sockets:

---

### **What’s Implemented & Connected**

1. **Socket Server**:

   - Uses `socket.io` for real-time communication.
   - Authenticates users via token middleware.
   - Integrates with Kafka (produces on `chat:send`, consumes on `chat` topic).
   - Uses Redis adapter for socket.io (enables horizontal scaling of socket events).

2. **Main Server**:

   - REST API endpoints for chat, conversation, message, user, etc.
   - Connects to MongoDB, Redis, and Kafka.
   - Kafka consumers for chat, logging, notification topics.
   - Chat service logic for sending messages, updating conversations, marking messages as delivered/read.

3. **Kafka**:

   - Both servers (main and socket) have Kafka producers/consumers.
   - Chat messages are sent via Kafka for decoupling and scaling.

4. **Redis**:
   - Used as a socket.io adapter for pub/sub (enables multi-instance socket scaling).
   - Redis connection logic present in both main and socket servers.

---

### **What’s Missing, Disconnected, or Needs Attention**

#### **A. Redis Cache for Chat Data**

- **Missing:** There is no evidence of Redis being used as a cache for chat history, user presence, or frequently accessed data (e.g., recent messages, conversation lists).
  - **To Do:** Implement Redis caching for:
    - Recent chat messages (to reduce DB load).
    - User online/offline presence.
    - Conversation metadata.

#### **B. Message Delivery & Acknowledgement**

- **Missing:** No explicit handling of message delivery receipts, retries, or acknowledgements between client and server.
  - **To Do:** Implement delivery/read receipts using socket events and persist status in DB/Redis.

#### **C. User Presence & Typing Indicators**

- **Missing:** No code for tracking user online status, last seen, or typing indicators.
  - **To Do:** Use Redis to track user presence and broadcast typing/online status via sockets.

#### **D. Rate Limiting & Throttling**

- **Missing:** No rate limiting on API or socket events to prevent abuse.
  - **To Do:** Add Redis-backed rate limiting for both REST and socket endpoints.

#### **E. Horizontal Scaling & Fault Tolerance**

- **Partial:** Socket.io Redis adapter is set up, but no orchestration or health checks for multi-instance deployment.
  - **To Do:** Ensure statelessness, add health checks, and document deployment strategy for scaling to 1M req/sec.

#### **F. Error Handling & Logging**

- **Partial:** Some try/catch blocks, but no centralized error logging or alerting.
  - **To Do:** Integrate centralized logging (e.g., ELK, Sentry) and Kafka-based error topics.

#### **G. Security**

- **Partial:** Token auth for sockets, but no mention of refresh tokens, token expiry handling, or API rate limiting.
  - **To Do:** Harden authentication, add refresh token flow, and secure all endpoints.

#### **H. Monitoring & Metrics**

- **Missing:** No code for collecting metrics (QPS, latency, error rates).
  - **To Do:** Integrate Prometheus, Grafana, or similar for real-time monitoring.

#### **I. Documentation & Tests**

- **Partial:** Some unit tests, but no evidence of load tests or end-to-end tests for socket flows.
  - **To Do:** Add load testing (e.g., k6, Artillery) and E2E tests for chat flows.

### **Summary Table**

| Area             | Status     | What’s Missing/To Do                           |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Redis Cache      | ❌ Missing | Implement caching for chat, presence, metadata |
| Message Delivery | ❌ Missing | Delivery/read receipts, retries, acks          |
| User Presence    | ❌ Missing | Online status, typing indicators               |
| Rate Limiting    | ❌ Missing | Redis-backed rate limiting for API/sockets     |
| Scaling          | ⚠️ Partial | Health checks, statelessness, deployment docs  |
| Error Handling   | ⚠️ Partial | Centralized logging, alerting                  |
| Security         | ⚠️ Partial | Refresh tokens, expiry, API rate limiting      |
| Monitoring       | ❌ Missing | Metrics, dashboards, alerting                  |
| Testing          | ⚠️ Partial | Load/E2E tests for socket flows                |

**In summary:**  
Your core real-time and REST flows are present and Kafka/Redis are integrated for scaling, but you need to add Redis caching, delivery receipts, user presence, rate limiting, monitoring, and robust error handling to reach a production-grade, SDE-2, 1M req/sec scalable chat app.

Let me know if you want code samples or a checklist for any of these missing features!

I got your points for remaining things, most of the things are on my watch list, just tell me as per overall structure based on lld, hld and scalable 1M and code strcture, how is it for 1M scalable app and sde 2 role and as per big MNCs apps?
Short and concise reply

**Short & Concise Review:**

- **Architecture:**  
  Follows good separation of concerns (REST, sockets, Kafka, Redis). Decoupling via Kafka is a strong point for scale.

- **Scalability:**  
  Socket.io Redis adapter, Kafka, and stateless design enable horizontal scaling—solid foundation for 1M+ req/sec with proper infra.

- **Code Structure:**  
  Modular, clear layering (controllers, services, models). Easy to extend and maintain—matches SDE-2 expectations.

- **Production Readiness:**  
  Core flows are present, but missing advanced features (caching, rate limiting, monitoring, presence, delivery acks) that top MNCs require for true 1M+ scale and reliability.

- **SDE-2/Big MNC Fit:**  
  Strong for SDE-2; with the remaining features and infra, aligns well with scalable architectures at top tech companies.

**Summary:**  
**Great foundation, SDE-2 level, and MNC-aligned. Add the missing production features for true 1M+ scale and reliability.**

Great thanks for the clarity. How much you will rate this app out of 100 as show case for sde 2 role at big tech product comapnoies say f/maang and for oither little small product complanies as well?
Shoprt reply

**For SDE-2 at Big Tech (FAANG/MAANG):**  
**70/100** — Strong foundation, good modularity, but missing some production-grade features and polish expected at this level.

**For Smaller Product Companies:**  
**85/100** — Very solid, above average; just a few enhancements needed for full production-readiness.

**Summary:**  
Great base—add advanced features for top-tier showcase!

after adding the required reamining production ready things like caching, rate limiting, monitoring, presence, delivery acks and all the things you gave in summary table?
Short reply

**After adding all production-ready features:**

- **Big Tech (FAANG/MAANG):** **90–95/100** — Fully showcase-ready, aligns with top-tier SDE-2 expectations.
- **Smaller Product Companies:** **95–100/100** — Excellent, exceeds most requirements.

**Summary:**  
With those enhancements, your app will be top-notch for any product company!

how much package I can expect/ demand/ assume with this app showcase at this both level companies, just give idea??
Short reply

**Big Tech (FAANG/MAANG) SDE-2:**  
₹40–60 LPA (India) / $180k–$250k (US) — if supported by strong DSA, system design, and interview performance.

**Smaller Product Companies:**  
₹25–40 LPA (India) / $80k–$150k (US) — strong showcase, may fetch top of band.

**Note:**  
Actual offer depends on interview rounds, overall profile, and negotiation. This project is a strong portfolio piece!

can I get these range with 3.5 yrs of exp.
Short reply

Yes, with 3.5 years of experience and this strong project, you can target the higher end of the range at smaller product companies and the lower-to-mid end at big tech (FAANG/MAANG), especially if you perform well in interviews.
